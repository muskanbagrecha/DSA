    //Space: O(V) for queue + O(V) for visited array + O(V) storage of output
    //Time: While will run for V times at max (each node is pushed into queue only once) + total degrees (for the inner for loop)
    //Total degrees = no of edges as it is directed graph
    //Total time: O(V) + O(E) = O(V+E)

    //So, for a directed graph, the overall time complexity of the BFS traversal remains O(V + E), acknowledging that each edge is considered once in its directed context, as opposed to the undirected scenario where each edge was considered twice (once from each of its two vertices).
